## Section A -- What Is a Statistical Hypothesis Framework in AgentCert?

A **statistical hypothesis framework** replaces single-number summaries (means, rates) with formal probabilistic inference. Instead of asking *"what is the mean time_to_detect?"*, we ask *"what is the confidence interval around mean time_to_detect, does it meet SLA thresholds, how consistent is it across fault categories, and is there evidence of drift over time?"*

> **Framework Context:** This evaluates **one agent** using **30+ runs per fault category** to ensure statistical validity. The framework operates in **two modes**:
> - **No-SLA Mode:** Provides confidence intervals, cross-category comparisons, effect sizes, and variance stability checks.
> - **SLA-Aware Mode:** Adds threshold compliance testing, breach rate estimation, equivalence testing, tail risk analysis, survival analysis, and drift detection against predefined SLA targets.
>
> All 9 hypotheses always run. Hypotheses H-01 through H-05 provide the core evaluation. Hypotheses H-06 through H-09 activate additional SLA-specific tests when SLA thresholds are provided, and provide informational analysis even without SLAs.

### What This Framework Delivers

| Capability | Description | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Uncertainty Quantification** | Wilson CI, Bootstrap CI, and IQM provide confidence intervals -- not just point estimates. | Both |
| **Cross-Category Analysis** | Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney U, Welch's ANOVA, and Fisher's Exact tests compare fault types. | Both |
| **Effect Size Measurement** | Vargha-Delaney A12 quantifies how large differences actually are -- beyond statistical significance. | Both |
| **Stability Testing** | Levene's test and CV analysis ensure consistent performance across runs. | Both |
| **SLA Threshold Compliance** | Wilcoxon one-sample test and Bootstrap CI vs SLA threshold prove performance meets requirements. | SLA |
| **Breach Rate Estimation** | Exact binomial test quantifies SLA violation frequency with confidence bounds. | SLA |
| **Equivalence Testing** | TOST proves performance is *within* SLA bounds, not just "not different from." | SLA |
| **Tail Risk Analysis** | CVaR and expected overshoot quantify severity of worst-case SLA violations. | SLA |
| **Survival Analysis** | Kaplan-Meier curves model time-dependent SLA compliance probability. | SLA |
| **Drift Detection** | CUSUM/EWMA control charts detect performance trending toward SLA violation. | SLA |

## Section B -- How to Use This Framework (Step-by-Step)

### Three-Phase Workflow

#### Phase 1: BUILD HYPOTHESIS
- Choose from 9 pre-defined hypotheses (H-01 to H-09)
- If SLA thresholds exist, configure them per fault type and per metric
- Select appropriate statistical method
- Document expected "steady state" behavior

#### Phase 2: SET UP MONITORING
- Deploy Langfuse OTEL trace store
- Configure LiteLLM Proxy for multi-model routing
- Set up MongoDB for 30+ runs per fault type
- Enable bucketing & extraction pipeline

#### Phase 3: CONDUCT EXPERIMENT & GENERATE CERTIFICATION
- Run agent 30+ times per fault category (application, network, resource)
- Inject faults using Litmus Chaos
- Collect traces via MCP protocol
- Apply statistical tests (H-01 to H-09)
- Generate comprehensive certification report (scorecard, findings, assessments, recommendations)

## Section C -- The Nine Hypotheses: What We Test and Why

### C.1 Understanding the Problem: Testing AI Agents Under Chaos

AgentCert evaluates how well AI agents handle real Kubernetes production failures by injecting controlled faults and measuring the agent's ability to detect, diagnose, and remediate them. We test across **three fault categories** that mirror real-world outages:

**Application Faults**
- **container-kill** -- Pod crashes, container restarts, CrashLoopBackOff
- **pod-delete** -- Pod termination, replica set reconciliation

*Tests: Restart detection, service restoration*

**Network Faults**
- **pod-network-loss** -- Packet drop, network partitions
- **pod-network-corruption** -- Packet corruption, data integrity failures
- **pod-network-rate-limit** -- Bandwidth throttling, latency spikes
- **pod-dns-error** -- DNS resolution failures, service discovery issues

*Tests: Connectivity diagnosis, routing problem detection*

**Resource Faults**
- **disk-fill** -- Disk exhaustion, I/O pressure, storage saturation
- **pod-cpu-hog** -- CPU saturation, throttling, performance degradation
- **pod-memory-hog** -- Memory pressure, OOMKill risk
- **pod-autoscaler** -- HPA/VPA misconfiguration, scaling failures

*Tests: Resource constraint identification, remediation*

> **Real-World Production Scenarios**
> - **Application:** Pods OOMKilled, app crashes, deployment rollout failures, pod evictions
> - **Network:** Microservices unable to reach databases/APIs, DNS outages, intermittent packet loss, bandwidth saturation
> - **Resource:** Nodes running out of ephemeral storage, CPU throttling, memory pressure, autoscaler deadlocks

We run the agent **~30 times per fault** across **10 fault types** (2 application x 4 network x 4 resource) and aggregate results at **three levels**:

- **Per-Fault Level:** 30 runs of pod-delete -> mean, median, std dev, P95
- **Fault-Category Level:** All application faults (container-kill + pod-delete) -> weighted avg, worst-case status
- **Overall Agent Level:** All categories (app + network + resource) -> certification scorecard

> \* H-08 and H-09 provide informational analysis even without SLAs (tail behavior and temporal trends are useful regardless). With SLAs, they add threshold-specific analysis.

---

### C.3 Core Hypotheses (H-01 to H-05) -- Always Active

#### H-01: Confidence Intervals for Continuous Metrics

**In plain English:** "How fast does this agent actually respond — and how confident are we in that number?"

**Question:** What's the agent's *true typical* performance with precision bounds?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The observed IQM is a noisy estimate — the true typical performance is unknown and could be anywhere.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** The Bootstrap CI provides a reliable bound on where the true typical performance lies.
- **Certification rule:** If the CI is narrow enough to be actionable (e.g., [210s, 280s] vs. a vague [100s, 500s]), the estimate is trustworthy.

**Metrics:** time_to_detect, time_to_mitigate, reasoning_score, hallucination_score

**Workflow:**
1. Collect n=30-40 runs per fault category
2. Compute: **IQM** (25% trimmed mean), Median, P95, Mean (reference)
3. Bootstrap CI: Resample 10k times from your 30-40 runs -> distribution of IQMs -> 95% CI

**Why:** Single point estimate from lucky/unlucky runs misleads. IQM trims outliers (top/bottom 25%) yet retains efficiency (uses 50% of data). CI reveals precision. Bootstrap doesn't assume normality.

**Benefit:** IQM is **robust to LLM retry loops and transient failures** (Agarwal NeurIPS 2021). Median + P95 provide tail behavior. Mean shown for reference.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> time_to_detect: IQM=245s [210-280s BCa CI], median=242s, P95=452s, mean=293s
> ```
> **Narrative:** "The agent demonstrates **reliable fault detection** with typical response time of 4.1 minutes (IQM). The narrow confidence interval (210-280s) indicates consistent performance. 95% of detections complete within 7.5 minutes. **Note: Raw mean (293s) inflated by 3 outlier runs (800s+) from LLM retry loops -- IQM provides more accurate typical-case estimate.**"

---

#### H-02: Success Rate Estimation with Safety Floor

**In plain English:** "What percentage of faults does this agent actually catch — and what's the worst-case guarantee?"

**Question:** What % of faults does the agent successfully detect and mitigate?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The observed success rate (e.g., 80%) may overstate the true rate due to small sample size.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** The Wilson CI lower bound provides a conservative floor on the true success rate.
- **Certification rule:** The lower bound of the Wilson CI is the "certified floor" — the minimum rate we can guarantee with 95% confidence.

**Derived Metrics:** fault_detection_success_rate, fault_mitigation_success_rate, false_negative_rate, false_positive_rate, rai_compliance_rate, security_compliance_rate

**Workflow:**
1. Count successes out of n=30-40 runs
2. Calculate rate: successes / total
3. Wilson score interval -> 95% CI
4. Report **lower bound** as safety floor

**Why:** 24/30 = 80% nominally, but true rate could be 62%-91%. Lower bound is conservative safety guarantee.

**Benefit:** Certification based on worst-case estimate. Wilson handles small n and extreme proportions (0%, 100%).

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> fault_detection_success_rate: 24/30 = 80.0% [62.1%-91.4% Wilson CI] | Certified Floor: 62%
> ```
> **Narrative:** "Under adversarial testing conditions, the agent successfully detected 80% of injected faults (24 out of 30 test runs). **Conservative certification guarantees a minimum 62% detection rate** with 95% confidence."

---

#### H-03: Cross-Category Performance Comparison

**In plain English:** "Does this agent handle network faults just as well as application faults — or does it struggle with specific fault types?"

**Question:** Does the agent handle all fault categories equally, or struggle with specific types?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The agent's performance is the same across all fault categories. Any observed differences are due to random variation.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** At least one fault category has significantly different (worse or better) performance than the others.
- **Certification rule:** If H₀ is rejected (p < 0.05), identify which categories differ using pairwise tests and quantify the gap with A₁₂ effect size.

**Compare:** Application vs. Network vs. Resource -- time_to_detect, time_to_mitigate, reasoning_score

**Workflow:**
1. **Kruskal-Wallis (omnibus):** "Any difference?" -> one p-value (controls Type I error)
2. **IF p<0.05:** Mann-Whitney U pairwise -> "Which pairs differ?" (App-Net, App-Res, Net-Res)
3. **For each pair:** Vargha-Delaney A12 -> "How big?" (0.5=same, 0.71+=large gap)

**Why:** Overall average hides category-specific weaknesses. Resource faults 3x slower = deployment risk.

**Benefit:** Identifies hidden gaps. A12 separates statistical significance from practical importance.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> Kruskal-Wallis H=18.4, p=0.0001 | Resource vs App: Mann-Whitney U p=0.007, A12=0.92 (large)
> ```
> **Narrative:** "Significant performance disparity detected across fault categories (p<0.001). **Resource exhaustion faults take 3x longer to detect** than application faults (median 612s vs 198s). The effect size (A12=0.92) indicates Resource faults are slower in 92% of head-to-head comparisons -- a **critical operational gap**."

---

#### H-04: Cross-Category Success Rate Uniformity

**In plain English:** "Does this agent fail network faults more often than application faults — or is the success rate roughly the same everywhere?"

**Question:** Are success rates uniform across categories, or does the agent fail certain fault types?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** Success rates are the same across all fault categories. The agent is equally likely to succeed regardless of fault type.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** At least one fault category has a significantly different success rate — the agent is more likely to fail on some fault types than others.
- **Certification rule:** If H₀ is rejected (Fisher's p < 0.05), the agent has a category-specific blind spot that must be addressed or disclosed.

**Compare:** fault_detection_success_rate, fault_mitigation_success_rate, rai_compliance_rate across App/Net/Res

**Workflow:**
1. Build 2x3 contingency table: success/fail x app/network/resource
2. Fisher's Exact Test -> p-value (exact, no approximation)
3. If p<0.05: identify weakest category

**Why:** 90% app + 50% network + 70% resource = 70% overall. Average masks 50% network failure rate.

**Benefit:** Reveals category-specific failure modes. Critical for deployment planning.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> App: 27/30 (90%) | Network: 15/30 (50%) | Resource: 21/30 (70%) | Fisher's Exact p=0.003
> ```
> **Narrative:** "**Network fault mitigation shows unacceptable failure rate** (50% success vs. 90% for application faults). Statistical analysis confirms this disparity is not due to random chance (Fisher's p=0.003)."

---

#### H-05: Consistency & Predictability (Variance Stability)

**In plain English:** "Can you rely on this agent to behave the same way every time — or is it fast one minute and slow the next?"

**Question:** Is the agent's performance *consistent* or wildly unpredictable?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The variance of performance is the same across all fault categories. The agent is equally predictable regardless of fault type.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** At least one fault category has significantly higher variance — the agent is erratic and unpredictable for some fault types.
- **Certification rule:** If CV > 0.30 for any category, flag it as unstable. If Levene's test rejects H₀ (p < 0.05), variance differs significantly across categories.

**Metrics:** Std Dev (sigma) and Coefficient of Variation (CV = sigma/mu) for time_to_detect, time_to_mitigate, reasoning_score

**Workflow:**
1. Compute sigma and CV per category
2. Levene's test: "Does variance differ across categories?" -> p-value
3. CV interpretation: <0.15 stable | 0.15-0.30 moderate | >0.30 unstable (red flag)

**Why:** Agent detecting disk-fill in 10s, then 500s, then 30s = **unreliable** (even if mean=180s looks OK).

**Benefit:** Identifies erratic categories. High variance = certification concern. Users need predictable performance.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> Network: sigma=404s, CV=1.40 | Resource: sigma=106s, CV=0.38 | App: sigma=52s, CV=0.14 | Levene's p=0.02
> ```
> **Narrative:** "**Network fault detection exhibits unacceptable variance** (CV=1.40, classified as unstable). Detection times range from 45 seconds to 18 minutes for identical fault types."

---

### C.4 SLA-Aware Hypotheses (H-06 to H-09)

> These hypotheses add SLA-specific analysis when SLA thresholds are provided. H-08 and H-09 also provide useful informational analysis in no-SLA mode.

#### H-06: SLA Threshold Compliance

**In plain English:** "Can we prove this agent meets the SLA — not just on average, but with statistical confidence?"

**Question:** Does the agent's typical performance meet the SLA threshold?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The agent's true median performance does NOT meet the SLA (median ≥ SLA threshold for time-based metrics, i.e., too slow).
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** The agent's true median performance IS within the SLA (median < SLA threshold).
- **Certification rule:** Reject H₀ (Wilcoxon p < 0.05) AND CI upper bound ≤ SLA → PASS. CI contains SLA → CONDITIONAL. CI lower bound > SLA → FAIL.

**Applicable when:** SLA thresholds are defined (e.g., TTD ≤ 300s, TTM ≤ 600s)

**Workflow:**
1. Compute IQM + Bootstrap CI for each metric
2. Compare CI upper bound against SLA threshold
3. Run Wilcoxon one-sample test: H₀: median ≥ SLA vs Hₐ: median < SLA
4. Classify result:
   - **PASS:** CI upper bound ≤ SLA (strong evidence of compliance)
   - **CONDITIONAL:** CI contains SLA threshold (may or may not comply)
   - **FAIL:** CI lower bound > SLA (even best estimate violates)

**Method Decision Hierarchy:**
| Priority | Method | Role | When to use |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Wilcoxon one-sample signed-rank | Core compliance test | Always run — non-parametric, robust to skew |
| Supplementary | Bootstrap CI vs SLA | Visual + directional evidence | Already computed by H-01; just compare CI upper bound against SLA |
| Supplementary | TOST (equivalence test) | Formal equivalence proof + power analysis | Adds sample-size justification. **Note:** for one-sided metrics (e.g., TTD ∈ [0, SLA]), the lower-bound test (mean > 0) is trivially true, reducing TOST to a one-sided t-test — essentially the parametric complement of Wilcoxon |
| Supplementary | Kaplan-Meier survival | Censored-data compliance | Only when right-censored runs exist (fault never detected within observation window). S(SLA) gives breach probability accounting for censoring |

**Why:** Meeting SLA "on average" is insufficient. We need statistical confidence that the true performance level is within SLA bounds. The Wilcoxon test is non-parametric, handling the right-skewed response time distributions typical of LLM agents. The supplementary methods each add a distinct lens: Bootstrap CI provides visual evidence, TOST adds formal equivalence framing with power analysis, and Kaplan-Meier properly handles censored observations that other methods cannot.

**Benefit:** Formal statistical proof of SLA compliance, not just observed averages. Conservative by design -- certifies only when evidence is strong.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> time_to_detect (SLA: ≤300s): IQM=245s [210-280s BCa CI] | CI upper 280s < SLA 300s
> Wilcoxon signed-rank: p=0.003 (reject H0: median ≥ 300s) | Verdict: PASS
> ```
> **Narrative:** "The agent's typical detection time (IQM=245s) falls within the 300-second SLA with statistical confidence. The bootstrap CI upper bound (280s) is below the SLA threshold, and the Wilcoxon test confirms the median is significantly below 300s (p=0.003). **SLA compliance certified.**"

**No-SLA Mode:** Skipped (no threshold to test against). H-01 provides the underlying CI estimation.

---

#### H-07: SLA Breach Rate Estimation

**In plain English:** "Even if most runs are fine, do too many runs violate the SLA? Can we prove the breach rate is below the allowed limit?"

**Question:** Is the SLA breach rate within acceptable limits?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The true SLA breach rate is at or above the allowed target (breach_rate ≥ target, e.g., ≥ 5%).
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** The true SLA breach rate is below the allowed target (breach_rate < target).
- **Certification rule:** Reject H₀ (binomial p < 0.05) → breach rate is certifiably below target. Fail to reject → insufficient evidence, need more runs.

**Applicable when:** SLA defines acceptable breach rates (e.g., "≤5% of runs may exceed TTD threshold")

**Workflow:**
1. Count SLA breaches: runs where metric exceeds SLA threshold
2. Exact binomial test: H₀: breach_rate ≥ target vs Hₐ: breach_rate < target
3. Wilson CI on breach rate (complement of compliance rate)
4. Report minimum sample size needed to certify at given breach rate

**Key Insight:** At n=30, proving breach_rate ≤ 5% requires observing 0 breaches. This drives sample size requirements.

**Why:** H-02 estimates overall success rates; H-07 specifically measures SLA violation frequency. An agent can have high detection success rate but still breach SLA timing requirements frequently.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> SLA breaches (TTD > 300s): 3/30 = 10.0% [3.5%-25.6% Wilson CI]
> Binomial test (H0: breach_rate ≥ 5%): p=0.184 | Cannot reject H0
> Verdict: FAIL -- insufficient evidence that breach rate is below 5% target
> Required n for 5% breach certification with 3% observed: n=93
> ```
> **Narrative:** "While only 3 out of 30 runs breached the 300s SLA, the Wilson CI upper bound (25.6%) does not exclude the possibility of a breach rate well above the 5% target. **At current sample size (n=30), we cannot statistically certify that breach rate is below 5%.** Recommend increasing to n=93 runs for definitive certification."

**No-SLA Mode:** Skipped (no breach threshold defined).

---

#### H-08: Tail Risk Analysis

**In plain English:** "When this agent fails, how badly does it fail? Is a bad run just a little slow, or catastrophically slow?"

**Question:** How severe are the worst-case outcomes? When SLA is breached, how bad are violations?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** Tail outcomes are not disproportionately severe — the worst 5% of runs are only marginally worse than the P95 value.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** Tail outcomes are disproportionately severe — the worst 5% average significantly worse than P95, indicating hidden catastrophic risk.
- **Certification rule:** If CVaR₉₅ / IQM ratio > 2x, flag as significant tail risk. If expected SLA overshoot is large, flag for operational risk.

**Always active (informational in no-SLA mode, threshold-specific with SLAs)**

**Workflow:**
1. **CVaR₉₅ (Conditional Value-at-Risk):** Average of worst 5% of outcomes
2. **P95 and P99** percentile values
3. **With SLA:** Expected SLA overshoot = E[X - SLA | X > SLA]
4. **Maximum observed violation**
5. Bootstrap CI on CVaR for uncertainty quantification

**Why:** P95 is a single point; CVaR reveals "when things go wrong, *how wrong* do they go?" An agent with P95=280s (within SLA) might have CVaR₉₅=850s (catastrophic tail). This is critical for incident response planning and SLA penalty estimation.

**Benefit:** Separates "occasionally slow" from "catastrophically slow." Directly maps to operational risk and SLA penalty costs.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> time_to_detect tail risk:
>   P95=452s | P99=890s | CVaR₉₅=672s [480-890s BCa CI]
>   SLA overshoot (when >300s): mean=234s, max=590s | 8/30 runs breached
> ```
> **Narrative (SLA mode):** "While median detection time (245s) meets the 300s SLA, tail analysis reveals **significant risk**: the worst 5% of runs average 672s (over 2x the SLA). When breaches occur, the average overshoot is 234s -- meaning SLA violations are not marginal but substantial."
>
> **Narrative (No-SLA mode):** "Tail analysis shows the worst 5% of detection runs average 672s, compared to the IQM of 245s. The 2.7x ratio between CVaR₉₅ and IQM indicates **meaningful tail risk** -- while typical performance is consistent, worst-case scenarios are significantly worse."

---

#### H-09: Temporal Stability & Drift Detection

**In plain English:** "Is this agent getting worse over time during the test — or is it rock-solid from run 1 to run 30?"

**Question:** Is the agent's performance stable over time, or is it drifting?

**Formal Hypotheses:**
- **H₀ (Null):** The agent's performance is stable over time — there is no systematic trend or structural change across the run sequence.
- **Hₐ (Alternative):** The agent's performance is drifting — there is a systematic trend (improving or degrading) or a structural break in the run sequence.
- **Certification rule:** CUSUM crossing threshold h or EWMA exceeding control limits → drift detected. Change point identified → structural break.

**Always active (detects general trends in no-SLA mode, SLA-specific drift with thresholds)**

**Workflow:**
1. **CUSUM (Cumulative Sum):** Track cumulative deviations from target. S_t = max(0, S_{t-1} + (x_t - k)). Signal when S_t > h.
   - With SLA: target = SLA threshold, detects drift toward violation
   - No-SLA: target = overall IQM, detects drift from baseline
2. **EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average):** Weighted average giving more weight to recent observations. Detects gradual degradation.
3. **Change Point Detection:** Identifies structural breaks in performance (e.g., after model update).
4. Classify drift: None / Improving / Degrading / Structural break

**Why:** An agent might pass all static tests (H-01 to H-05) but be *getting worse over time*. CUSUM detects the trend before actual SLA breach, enabling proactive intervention. This is especially critical for LLM agents where model updates, prompt changes, or context window effects can silently degrade performance.

**Power Caveat (n ≤ 30):** CUSUM and EWMA are designed for continuous monitoring with n >> 100 observations. At n=30 (the certification floor), these methods provide useful **trend signals** but have limited statistical power to detect small or moderate drift. Interpret drift verdicts at small n as directional indicators, not definitive conclusions. For high-stakes drift claims, collect additional runs or use sequential monitoring over multiple certification windows.

**Benefit:** Early warning system. Catches degradation trends before they become SLA violations or certification failures.

> **Output (Statistical):**
> ```
> CUSUM (TTD, target=IQM 245s): S_30 = 8.4 (below threshold h=15) | No drift detected
> EWMA (lambda=0.2): trend = +2.1s/run (slight upward drift, not significant)
> Change point: None detected (PELT algorithm, BIC penalty)
> Verdict: STABLE
> ```
> **Narrative:** "Performance is temporally stable across the 30 certification runs. No significant drift toward degradation detected. CUSUM remains below alert threshold, and EWMA shows only a marginal non-significant upward trend (+2.1s/run). **No evidence of model degradation during the testing period.**"

### C.5 Statistical Foundation

#### Hypothesis Framework: Questions, Formal Tests & Certification Use

| Test | Question | H₀ (Null Hypothesis) | Hₐ (Alternative Hypothesis) | Key Output |
|------|----------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------|
| **H-01** | How fast does the agent respond? | True typical performance is unknown | Bootstrap CI bounds the true IQM | IQM ± CI, Median, P95 |
| **H-02** | What % of faults are caught? | True success rate is unknown | Wilson CI lower bound = safety floor | Rate ± CI, certified floor |
| **H-03** | All fault types handled equally? | Performance is the same across all categories | At least one category differs significantly | p-value + A₁₂ effect size |
| **H-04** | Success rates uniform? | Success rates are the same across all categories | At least one category has different success rate | Per-category rates + p-value |
| **H-05** | Is performance consistent? | Variance is equal across all categories | At least one category has significantly higher variance | CV per category + Levene's p |
| **H-06** | Does it meet SLA? | Median ≥ SLA threshold (doesn't meet SLA) | Median < SLA threshold (meets SLA) | Pass / Conditional / Fail |
| **H-07** | Breach rate acceptable? | Breach rate ≥ allowed target | Breach rate < allowed target | Breach rate CI + required n |
| **H-08** | How bad are worst cases? | Tail outcomes are not disproportionately severe | Worst 5% are significantly worse than typical | CVaR₉₅, expected overshoot |
| **H-09** | Is it drifting over time? | Performance is stable across the run sequence | Systematic trend or structural break exists | CUSUM/EWMA trend + change points |

> **Key Distinction:**
> - **H-01 and H-02** are **estimation problems** (quantify uncertainty).
> - **H-03, H-04, H-05** are **hypothesis tests** (reject H0 "no difference" if p < alpha).
> - **H-06 and H-07** are **one-sided tests** against SLA thresholds.
> - **H-08 and H-09** are **diagnostic analyses** (tail risk and temporal trends).

### C.6 Method Justification: Why These Tests?

#### Core Methods (H-01 to H-05)

##### H-01 -- Bootstrap CI (BCa) + IQM

**Why NOT z-test/t-test CI:** Agent data has long-tail outliers (10x slow runs from LLM retries). Shapiro-Wilk would reject normality. At n=30-40, CLT is marginal for skewed distributions.

**Why ONLY This Works:** Bootstrap CI (BCa) + IQM -- no assumptions, works with ANY data shape. IQM (25% trimmed mean) robust to LLM outliers. BCa corrects for bias & skewness.

```python
from scipy.stats import bootstrap, trim_mean
def iqm(x): trim_mean(x, 0.25)
bootstrap((data,), iqm, n_resamples=10000, method='BCa')
```

##### H-02 -- Wilson Score Interval

**Why NOT Normal Approximation:** 29/30 success (96.7%) -> CI: [88.3%, **105.1%**] (exceeds 100%!). Poor coverage at n=30-40.

**Why ONLY This Works:** Wilson always stays [0-100%]. Industry standard for n<100. True 95% coverage at n=30-40.

```python
from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportion_confint
proportion_confint(count, nobs, method='wilson')
```

##### H-03 -- Kruskal-Wallis + Mann-Whitney U + A12

**Why NOT ANOVA:** Network faults are bimodal, resource faults are right-skewed. Equal variance unlikely.

**Why This Works:** Rank-based, distribution-free, outlier-resistant. A12 gives actionable effect size.

```python
from scipy.stats import kruskal, mannwhitneyu
kruskal(*groups)  # Step 1: omnibus
mannwhitneyu(a, b)  # Step 2: pairwise post-hoc
vargha_delaney()  # Step 3: effect size
```

##### H-04 -- Fisher's Exact Test

**Why NOT Chi-Square:** Fails at low cell counts (expected cells < 5 with 95%+ success rates).

**Why ONLY This Works:** No assumptions, exact p-value, handles any cell counts including 0.

```python
from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
fisher_exact(table)
```

##### H-05 -- Levene's Test + CV

**Why NOT Bartlett's/F-test:** Bartlett's extremely sensitive to normality. F-test only for 2 groups.

**Why This Works:** CV is self-explanatory ("140% variability" = unstable). Clear thresholds.

```python
import numpy as np
cv = np.std(data) / np.mean(data)
if cv > 0.30: flag_unstable
levene(a, b, c)  # Optional p-value
```

#### SLA-Specific Methods (H-06 to H-09)

##### H-06 -- Wilcoxon One-Sample + Bootstrap CI vs Threshold

**Why NOT one-sample t-test:** Agent response times are right-skewed with heavy tails. The Wilcoxon test uses ranks, making it robust to distribution shape.

**When t-test is OK:** Only when Shapiro-Wilk confirms normality (rare for agent timing data).

```python
from scipy.stats import wilcoxon
wilcoxon(data - threshold, alternative='less')
```

##### H-07 -- Exact Binomial Test

**Why this over z-test for proportions:** At small breach counts (e.g., 1/30), normal approximation is invalid. Exact binomial computes the exact probability. Clopper-Pearson CI provides guaranteed coverage.

```python
from scipy.stats import binomtest
binomtest(x_breaches, n, p=target, alternative='less')
```

##### H-08 -- CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk)

**Why CVaR over P95 alone:** P95 is a single threshold; CVaR₉₅ = average of worst 5% captures **severity**, not just frequency. An agent with P95=290s (within SLA) but CVaR₉₅=850s has catastrophic tail behavior hidden from percentile analysis.

```python
import numpy as np
sorted_data = np.sort(data)
cvar_95 = np.mean(sorted_data[int(0.95 * len(sorted_data)):])
overshoot = np.mean(data[data > sla] - sla)  # When SLA defined
```

##### H-09 -- CUSUM + EWMA

**Why control charts:** Static tests (H-01 to H-05) provide a snapshot; CUSUM/EWMA detect *trends*. An agent passing all static tests today might be degrading toward failure. CUSUM is sensitive to persistent shifts; EWMA detects gradual drift.

```python
import numpy as np
# CUSUM
target = np.mean(data)  # or SLA threshold
cusum = np.zeros(len(data))
for i in range(1, len(data)):
    cusum[i] = max(0, cusum[i-1] + (data[i] - target) - k)
```

### C.7 Implementation Details & Reference

#### LLM Council for Textual Metrics

> Narrative fields (agent_summary, rai_check_summary, security_compliance_summary, known_limitations, recommendations) cannot be averaged numerically. Instead, we use an **LLM Council** -- a panel of k=3-5 independent LLM judges that read all 30 per-run narratives and produce a consensus summary, severity label, and confidence score (High/Medium/Low).

#### Mode Selection

| Condition | Mode | Active Hypotheses |
|---|---|---|
| No SLA thresholds provided | No-SLA | H-01 to H-05 (full), H-08 & H-09 (informational) |
| SLA thresholds provided | SLA-Aware | H-01 to H-09 (all, full SLA-specific analysis) |

#### Key Concepts Glossary

| Concept | One-Sentence Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Confidence Interval (CI)** | A range where we're 95% sure the true answer lies. |
| **p-value** | The probability that the observed difference is just random luck. |
| **Effect Size (A12)** | How big a difference actually is -- even if "significant," it might be tiny. |
| **IQM (Interquartile Mean)** | 25% trimmed mean -- average of middle 50%, robust to outliers. |
| **Bootstrap (BCa)** | Measuring uncertainty by reshuffling data 10,000 times. BCa corrects for bias and skewness. |
| **Wilson CI** | CI for success rates that works correctly with small samples or extreme values. |
| **Kruskal-Wallis / Mann-Whitney** | Rank-based group comparisons -- no bell-curve assumption needed. |
| **Fisher's Exact Test** | Exact probability test for success rates -- works even with small cell counts. |
| **Levene's Test + CV** | Variance stability test. CV = std/mean -- shows reliability. |
| **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank** | Non-parametric test comparing observations against a threshold (SLA). |
| **Exact Binomial Test** | Tests whether an observed breach rate is within an acceptable limit. |
| **TOST (Two One-Sided Tests)** | Proves performance is *within* bounds, not just "not different from." |
| **CVaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk)** | Average of worst 5% of outcomes -- measures tail severity. |
| **Kaplan-Meier** | Survival curve estimating probability of completing within a time limit. |
| **CUSUM** | Control chart detecting cumulative drift from a target value. |
| **EWMA** | Weighted moving average emphasizing recent observations for trend detection. |
| **Error Budget** | Allowed SLA breach count per window -- tracks consumption toward SLA violation. |
| **Holm-Bonferroni** | Correction for running multiple tests -- prevents false positives from chance. |
| **Worst-Category Assessment** | Judge the agent by its worst fault category, not its best. |
